First, I made a `sudo mkdir -p` to a folder named "NetowrkDrives", then I take ownership of them with `chown`. (drives were mounted with `sudo mount -a` while learning the process)

Then I edited that folder's CIFS in FSTAB to make it so the disk will automatically mount on boot.


I then reloaded the system state to authorize the modification,...



...and then used `df -h` and `lsblk` to check the mounted drives.
